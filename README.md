# p1x1

## abstract

p1x1 is an open-source Angular based web application for cataloging and archiving private photos in S3 compatible buckets, protecting content via a full-browser, client-side encryption logic.

Tags can be added to the media content uploaded so they can be later found easily thanks to the super flexible search system (even including boolean logic!). An impressive tag cloud is generated.

It also features extracting EXIF info from images, snapshot from videos, applying cool effects on pictures, mobilenet/tensorflow based image classification and sharing files without the recipient configuring an S3 account.
